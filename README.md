## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (v6 or higher)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TrojanRocks/SQL-runner.git
cd sql-runner
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

### Writing Queries
The application supports the following SQL-like operations:

1. Basic SELECT:
```sql
SELECT * FROM categories
```

2. Filtering with WHERE:
```sql
SELECT * FROM categories WHERE categoryName = 'Beverages'
```

3. Pattern matching:
```sql
SELECT * FROM categories WHERE description LIKE '%drinks%'
```

4. Sorting:
```sql
SELECT * FROM categories ORDER BY categoryName DESC
```

### Managing Queries
- Click the save icon (üíæ) to save the current query
- Click the history icon (üìú) to view and load saved queries
- Use the play button (‚ñ∂Ô∏è) to execute a loaded query
- Queries are automatically saved in your browser's local storage

### Working with Results
- Use the copy icon (üìã) to copy results to clipboard
- Use the download icon (‚¨áÔ∏è) to export results as CSV
- Navigate through pages using the pagination controls
- Adjust the number of rows displayed per page (5, 10, 25, or 50)
- View the total number of rows in the results
- Results are displayed in a sortable, responsive table

## Available Tables

### Categories
- categoryID (number)
- categoryName (string)
- description (string)
- picture (binary)

### Users
- id (number)
- name (string)
- email (string)
- role (string)

### Orders
- id (number)
- user_id (number)
- product (string)
- amount (number)
- date (string)
